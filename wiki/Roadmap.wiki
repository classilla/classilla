= Roadmap =

This document is always subject to change, but basically covers which version of Classilla will come out when. In keeping with the OS 9-specific motif, initial versions will be numbered according to official Apple versions of OS 9 (while they last).

==Classilla 9.0==

This was the first release of Classilla with the updated "Clecko" layout engine. It is roughly the equivalent of Mozilla 1.6, but this is not exact (it lacks some 1.6 features, but also adds features from as late as 1.8). This version had layout and multiple security improvements, along with changes for rebranding and Mac-specific bug fixes.

This version was intentionally unfinished -- since WaMCom is no longer updated, this is the only version of Mozilla for the classic Mac that is even still theoretically maintained, so its release was accelerated to ensure continuity. For that reason, it was released in 'pre-alpha' form on June 30th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.0.4==

This was the second release of Classilla. It added additional security and network improvements from Bugzilla, and updates to !JavaScript and DOM. Additional layout improvements were also present in this release, along with an experimental fixup rendering mode for sites that cannot be rendered with the standard layout engine, and various other MacOS-specific stability and functionality issues were also repaired. This was the final version to support Chatzilla.

Classilla 9.0.4 was released on October 28th, 2009.

==Classilla 9.1==

This is the third release of Classilla. This version restores the layout overflow branch (replacing the 9.0.4 experimental renderer), allowing more advanced rendering and further improvements with site compatibility, roughly somewhere between Mozilla 1.7 and 1.8. It will also fix the most important regressions caused by 9.0.4 while maintaining the vast majority of its improvements, improve stability, and add and repair additional useability features.

Classilla 9.1 is planned for release on March 15th, 2010.

==Classilla 9.1.1 through 9.1.9==

These will likely be placeholder releases for a planned complete rewrite of !JavaScript, as well as possibly NSS and libnecko. This will be detailed more when 9.1 is released. Official localization will also commence with these releases.

==Classilla 9.2==

Future.
