This page will be for frequent user questions. Some of these are also answered on the main site, but are also here for convenient reference.


==What is Classilla?==
Classilla is an updated open-source Mozilla-based web browser for the classic Macintosh OS (not Mac OS X, although it will run under Classic through 10.4). It is targeted for Mac OS 9, but will include 8.6 compatibility where possible.

The name is, naturally, a portmanteau of _Classic_ (for the classic MacOS) and _Mozilla_.

==What is Mozilla?==
Mozilla is the force behind the Gecko layout engine, which powers (among others) Mozilla Firefox, currently the second most popular web browser in the world behind Microsoft Internet Explorer. This makes it a very popular foundation for building other browsers and browser-like software upon.

==What is Clecko?==
Clecko is the fork of Gecko used in Classilla. Mozilla ended official Mac OS 9 support with 1.2, although versions through 1.3.1 would still generally build if the patches for OS X (the old Fizzilla build) were removed. 

Because Mozilla 1.4 and up include so much OS X specific code that won't work with the !CarbonLib available for Mac OS 9, the decision was made to split Gecko off at 1.3.1 (using the Gecko that was maintained in the venerable old WaMCom build) and backport later changes to it rather than use the Mozilla code base directly, which won't build. This version of Gecko thus has a significantly different lineage despite having a common ancestor, and while its sources are similar, its provenance and feature set are therefore necessarily different. To avoid confusion with the main Gecko, even though this forked Gecko is still mostly official Mozilla code, Classilla's version of Gecko was renamed Clecko.

==What was WaMCom?==
[http://www.wamcom.org/ WaMCom] was Kai Engert's maintained version of Mozilla 1.3.1; the Mac build of WaMCom is the direct ancestor of Classilla. It is no longer supported or developed.

==Does Mozilla support Classilla or Clecko?==
No, and it is highly unlikely they will ever support OS 9 at all again given the niche user base. For this reason, *you should not ask Mozilla for support of Classilla/Clecko, nor should you file Bugzilla entries about bugs in Classilla.* If there is a specific issue that merits Bugzilla notation, let the Classilla project leads determine that on your behalf.

==When will new versions of Classilla come out?==
See [Roadmap].

==What is Bugzilla? What are Bugzilla numbers?==
Strictly speaking [http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ Bugzilla] refers to either the Bugzilla software package, or Mozilla's own Bugzilla installation which is used for tracking Mozilla bugs. In our usage, we almost always mean the latter sense. A Bugzilla number refers to the ID number of a specific issue in the Bugzilla database, with its associated patch(es), if any. *If your bug report corresponds to a specific Bugzilla number, including that in your report helps immensely as there may already be a patch that can be adapted.*

Again, you should *not* file Bugzilla issues for Classilla.

==Can I run Classilla on OS X?==
Yes. In fact, Classilla may be the best browser option for you if you are running a very old version of OS X such as 10.0 or 10.1, but you must run it in Classic as it is not Carbonized. If you are using 10.2, however, you should probably consider Firefox 2 as its compatibility is currently better than Classilla, and if you are using 10.3 Camino 1.6.x is a far better choice and currently supported. 10.4 is currently supported by all major browsers.

Please note that depending on your version of OS X, the Classic environment may (in some cases noticibly) degrade Classilla's performance. Classilla is naturally always fastest in a native, non-emulated environment.

To run Classilla on an Intel Macintosh or on 10.5 or later, since neither support Classic, you must use an emulator such as !SheepShaver. Although it is not officially supported, people have used Classilla on !SheepShaver and demonstrated that it runs well. !SheepShaver on BeOS is also compatible. Again, its performance under emulation may be significantly impacted. Classilla does not run under Basilisk II, because that is a 68K Mac emulator (see the next question).

==Can I run Classilla on a 68K Macintosh?==
Not natively. Classilla is currently built with a version of !CodeWarrior that only supports PowerPC, and relies on certain specific features of OS 8.5 and later such as Unicode support. It is possible to backport these features to OS 8.1 or possibly earlier, but that task is demonstrably non-trivial, and the memory demands may seriously restrict which machines could run Classilla even if those constraints were otherwise met.

However, if you have *a 68K Mac with a PowerPC card* such as any of the 601-based PDS cards out there, those Macs _can_ run Classilla as long as you have sufficient memory and can boot 8.6 on them (the Sonnet PPC cards can with their enabler, for example). Please note that their performance will be, at best, pedestrian.

==Is Classilla localized or available in other languages?==
Not yet, but this is planned. There are already unofficial builds that some users have created themselves; while these are technically unsupported, they should work just fine. Eventually there will be official builds incorporating these user translations once all the localizable strings have stabilized.

Here are the user-contributed translations so far (send new ones to classilla at floodgap dawt com):

  * Japanese: http://page.freett.com/macos9/classilla_ja_20100130.html

==Does Classilla support Flash?==
Yes, but OS 9 support was dropped after Flash 7. *There are known security problems in that version of Adobe Flash Player and its use is strongly discouraged.* Still, this is enough to surf many sites and even view many videos, although people have reported synchronization issues with certain codecs. Your humble author, however, does not use it.

==Flash (and other plugins) make Classilla flicker really badly sometimes.==
This is a known and unfortunately unfixable bug due to the way plugins in general work in Mac OS 9. See issue 14.

==Does Classilla support Java?==
Yes, but only the version of Macintosh Runtime for Java that Apple provides with your version of Mac OS. *There are known security problems in all classic Mac OS versions of the MRJ and its use is strongly discouraged.* By default, Java is forced off in new profiles. You can turn it on from the preferences panel, but you should only use it on trusted sites.

==Will Classilla support HTML 5?==
Certain portions will be supported (and some actually already are invisibly). The most visible features such as CANVAS tags, however, will require extensive work for Clecko's non-Cairo-based graphics architecture, and features such as VIDEO and AUDIO tags may never be supported due to poor codec availability for OS 9. Networking support may also be difficult to integrate with the older Clecko codebase. There are no promises, let alone an ETA, for any of these features. On the other hand, most document-based tags are easy to incorporate into Classilla's parser and many of these are or will be supported.

Currently, however, the highest priority is making sure that HTML 4.01 and CSS 2 are supported to a functional level; this is incomplete, but improving.

==!JavaScript doesn't work in Classilla.==
Classilla uses its own special version of !NoScript due to gaps in its !JavaScript interpreter that can cause instability, security problems or crashing.

By default, *!NoScript is configured to block all !JavaScript* except on certain pages where it must be enabled. !NoScript appears in your Classilla window as a little "S" at the lower right which you can click to change its settings: either add the current website name to the white list, or, if you are adventurous or reckless, allow it on all pages. For more information, see the [http://www.classilla.org/releases/ Release Notes].

The version of !JavaScript in Classilla is old and while it works on many sites, it does not work on all of them.

==When !JavaScript is on, clicking on certain links doesn't work.==
There are two possible reasons:

  * The links themselves are in !JavaScript that Classilla can't understand. You must disable !JavaScript to navigate that particular site. The New York Times is an infamous example.

  * Sites using Microsoft ASP do not recognize Classilla as a Mozilla-based browser, and fail to insert the correct !JavaScript code for their links. To fix that, go to (in 9.0.4 and up) Preferences and change the User-Agent to Firefox, then reload the page and the links should start to function. Remember to change the User-Agent back when you're done. You can recognize these links because they look something like this:
{{{
javascript:__doPostBack('something', 'something else')
}}}
 
==Will Classilla's !JavaScript be updated?==
Classilla 9.0.4 and 9.1 both partially improve the performance and operation of !JavaScript, and a full rewrite is planned for a future release. Even so, *please only enable !JavaScript when absolutely necessary for a site to function.* It is much faster, safer and more stable to let !NoScript control !JavaScript for you rather than keeping it enabled all the time.

==Classilla disables Sherlock 2 on my non-English Mac.==
If you are using a non-English keyboard and running Sherlock 2 and Classilla at the same time, your keyboard will not work in Sherlock 2 (it will work fine elsewhere). This can be solved by temporarily switching to an English keyboard layout. It is currently being debated whether this is a Mozilla or Mac OS/Sherlock bug.

==Will Classilla still support Chatzilla?==
Chatzilla's final release under Classilla was with 9.0.4. It no longer appears in versions thereafter due to multiple known security flaws and difficulty integrating later versions with Classilla's older code base. There are many better IRC clients for Mac OS 9; you should use one of those instead. If you must use Chatzilla, you are limited to 9.0 and 9.0.4 (or WaMCom, etc.).

==Will Classilla still support mail and news?==
Currently, yes. There are enough users and enough user demand that Classilla will continue to support it for the immediate future. However, we do need testers to find and report bugs, as well as regular user reports. *You can help!*

==Will Classilla ever be as up-to-date as Firefox?==
That depends on the devotion and hardwork of the maintainers, leads and programmers. We're always looking for a few good Mac nerds.

==How can I help with Classilla? I only know HTML.==
You can still be a big help as a distiller. See [BeAPart].

==How can I help with Classilla? I'd like to code and build my own.==
To build your own Classilla on your own system, you need to set up a sane build environment. See HowToBuild.

Once you have Classilla built and want to do your own stuff to send in, you have to obey certain conventions for code (and to ensure that resource forks are not trampled upon). See [BeAPart] and HowToSubmit.

==My question is not answered by this document.==
If you have a specific issue with Classilla which you think is a bug, look under the Issues tab for what the coders are currently working on.

If you don't see a bug listed and you're sure you've found one, please use Report-A-Bug (don't file bugs here unless you are authorized to do so; [http://www.classilla.org/report Report-A-Bug] allows a reviewer to triage your bug so that the worklist is more efficiently updated).
